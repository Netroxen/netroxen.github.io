    title: About
    summary: |
      Born as a 90's kid into a technological boom, my interest in building computers, overclocking them
      and actively involving myself in various design and coding activities, lead me to creating web applications.

      England, I find myself pursuing web development in the hope, of making my own small mark on the internet highway.
