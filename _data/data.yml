    title: About
    summary: |
      Born as a 90's kid into a technological boom, my interest in building computers, overclocking them
      and actively involving myself in various design and coding activities sparked my enthusiasm into developing applications.
      
      Now residing in the foot hills of the Alps, having jumped pond from the home of tea time and chequered trousers,
      England, I find myself pursuing web development in the hopes of making my own small
      mark on the internet highway.

      I would consider myself a friendly and open minded person with great social skills and a willingness to learn new things.
